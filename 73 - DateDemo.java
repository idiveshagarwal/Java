}

In this code, we're using the System.currentTimeMillis() method to calculate and print the number of years since January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch) up to the current time.

package com.company;:
Specifies the package in which the class is located.

public class DateDemo {:
Defines the class named DateDemo.

public static void main(String[] args) {:
The main method where the execution of the program starts.

System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000 / 3600 / 24 / 365);:

System.currentTimeMillis() returns the current time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
Dividing by 1000 converts milliseconds to seconds.
Dividing by 3600 converts seconds to hours.
Dividing by 24 converts hours to days.
Dividing by 365 converts days to years.
The combined effect of these divisions is calculating the number of years that have passed since the Unix epoch up to the current time.
}:
Closes the main method.

}:
Closes the class definition.

Output:
The output of this code will be a large number representing the approximate number of years since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970) up to the current time.

Please note that this calculation is an approximation and might not give you an accurate age or timestamp. It's used to illustrate the concept of how time is represented in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
