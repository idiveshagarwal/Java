int a = 10;
if (a=11)
    System.out.println("I am 11");
else
    System.out.println("I am not 11");

The code snippet above contains an error and does not compile. The condition a=11 within the if statement should use the equality operator (==) instead of the assignment operator (=) to check if a is equal to 11. The corrected code would be:

int a = 10;
if (a == 11)
    System.out.println("I am 11");
else
    System.out.println("I am not 11");

In this case, since a is assigned a value of 10 and not 11, the condition is false, and the output will be "I am not 11".

public class PracticeSet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Question 1:
        int a = 11;
        if(a=11){

        }

        // Question 2
        byte m1, m2, m3;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your marks in Physics");
        m1 = sc.nextByte();
        
        // Rest of the code is commented out for brevity...
    }
}

The code in PracticeSet contains different question solutions related to conditional statements and user input. Each section is commented with a question number and its corresponding code.

Question 1: The code is incomplete and contains a syntax error. The condition within the if statement should use the equality operator (==) instead of the assignment operator (=).

Question 2: The code prompts the user to enter marks in three subjects and calculates the average. It then checks if the average is above or equal to 40 and if the marks in each subject are above or equal to 33. Based on the conditions, it prints a message indicating whether the user has been promoted or not.

Rest of the code: The remaining sections are commented out for brevity. They include solutions to other questions related to income tax calculation, switch case usage, and website identification based on the domain name.

Note: The commented code sections represent alternative examples or explanations and are not active in the code execution.
