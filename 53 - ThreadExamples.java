Code Name: ThreadExamples

Question and Description for Each Line:

Without threading:
class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Func1(); // Call the function Func1
        Func2(); // Call the function Func2
    }
}
This code defines a class ThreadExample with a main method. It tries to call two functions Func1 and Func2, but those functions are not defined within the provided code.

With threading:
class Multi extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("thread is running..."); // Print a message when the thread runs
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Multi func1 = new Multi(); // Create an instance of Multi thread
        func1.start(); // Start the first thread
        Multi func2 = new Multi(); // Create another instance of Multi thread
        func2.start(); // Start the second thread
    }
}
This code defines a class Multi that extends Thread. It creates two instances of the Multi class and starts two threads to execute the run method, which simply prints a message.


class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed when the thread runs
    }
}
This code defines a class MyThread that extends Thread. It provides a template for defining custom behavior in the run method when the thread is executed.
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 40000) {
            System.out.println("My Cooking Thread is Running"); // Print a message
            System.out.println("I am happy!"); // Print another message
            i++;
        }
    }
}

public class thread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread(); // Create an instance of MyThread
        t1.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
This code defines a class MyThread that extends Thread. The run method contains a loop that prints messages to simulate a cooking thread. The main method creates an instance of MyThread and starts the thread.
package com.company;

class MyThread1 extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 40000) {
            System.out.println("My Cooking Thread is Running"); // Print a message
            System.out.println("I am happy!"); // Print another message
            i++;
        }
    }
}

class MyThread2 extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 40000) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2 for Chatting with her"); // Print a message
            System.out.println("I am sad!"); // Print another message
            i++;
        }
    }
}

public class thread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread1 t1 = new MyThread1(); // Create an instance of MyThread1
        MyThread2 t2 = new MyThread2(); // Create an instance of MyThread2
        t1.start(); // Start the first thread
        t2.start(); // Start the second thread
    }
}
This code defines two classes, MyThread1 and MyThread2, each extending Thread. Both classes have a run method with loops that print messages. The main method creates instances of both classes and starts their respective threads.

Note: The code examples provided are quite repetitive and could be optimized by creating a common Runnable implementation for the thread behavior. This would reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
