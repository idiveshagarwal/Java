In the given code:

The commented lines describe the structure of the do-while loop. The loop executes the block of code first, and then checks the condition at the end of each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop repeats.

The active code includes a do-while loop that starts with initializing an integer variable i with a value of 1. The loop then prints the value of i, increments i by 1, and continues to the next iteration as long as i is less than or equal to 10.

The code also includes two other do-while loops with variables b and c. However, both loops will not execute because the initial values of b and c are already greater than the respective loop conditions (b < 5 and c <= 45).

When the do-while loop is used, the block of code is guaranteed to be executed at least once, even if the condition is false from the beginning.

The output of the active do-while loop will be the numbers 1 to 10 (printed sequentially). The other two loops will not produce any output due to the initial values of b and c being greater than their loop conditions.
