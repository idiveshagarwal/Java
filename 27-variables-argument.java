Code Name: calculate

The code defines a class named calculate that contains a method called add, which takes variable-length arguments of type int. The add method calculates the sum of the provided numbers and returns the result. The main method demonstrates the usage of the add method with different sets of arguments and prints the results.

Method add:

static int add(int ...arr){
    int result = 0;
    for (int a : arr){
        result = result + a;
    }
    return result;
}
This method takes a variable number of int arguments (int ...arr). It uses an enhanced for loop to iterate through the provided arguments, calculating their sum and storing it in the result variable. Finally, it returns the sum as the output.

main method:

public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println(add(1,2));
    System.out.println(add(2,3,4));
    System.out.println(add(4,5,6));
}
In the main method, three different sets of arguments are passed to the add method. The method is called with the arguments (1, 2), (2, 3, 4), and (4, 5, 6) respectively. The results of each call are then printed using System.out.println.

Output:

3
9
15
The output shows the sum of the provided numbers for each call to the add method. For example, add(1, 2) returns 3, add(2, 3, 4) returns 9, and add(4, 5, 6) returns 15.
