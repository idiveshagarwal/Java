In this code, you have three classes: A, B, and Javamethodoverriding.

Class A defines a method meth1() which prints a message. This method is inherited by class B.

Class B extends class A and overrides the meth1() method to print a different message.

Class Javamethodoverriding contains the main method where instances of classes A and B are created. The meth1() method is called on both instances, demonstrating method overriding behavior.

Regarding your questions:

The first code block has no method overriding. Both instances of class A and class B call the same meth1() method, as there's no overridden version in class B.

The second code block correctly demonstrates method overriding. The overridden meth1() method from class B is called when you use an instance of class B.

The third code block is missing the package declaration in your original code. I've included the corrected code with the package declaration. Additionally, in the main method, you're calling meth2() instead of meth1() for the instance of class A, and you're only calling meth2() for class B. I've kept the corrected version in the formatted code above.
