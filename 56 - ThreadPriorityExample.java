1. // Set the priority of the thread.
public final void setPriority(int x)   // x is the priority [1,10] that is to be set for the thread.
```
This comment explains the purpose of the `setPriority` method in Java's `Thread` class. The method is used to set the priority of a thread, where `x` is the desired priority value ranging from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).

2. // Get the priority of the thread.
t1.getPriority() // Will return the priority of the t1 thread.

This comment and line of code demonstrate how to retrieve the priority of a thread using the `getPriority` method. Here, `t1.getPriority()` returns the priority value of the thread `t1`.

class Priority extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("I'm thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName()); // Print thread's name
        System.out.println("I'm thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getPriority()); // Print thread's priority
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Priority t1 = new Priority(); // Create an instance of Priority
        Priority t2 = new Priority(); // Create another instance
        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);   // Set priority of t1 thread to MIN_PRIORITY (1)
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);   // Set priority of t2 thread to MAX_PRIORITY (10)
        t1.start();                            // Start t1 thread
        t2.start();                            // Start t2 thread
    }
}

This code defines a class `Priority` that extends `Thread`. The `run` method prints the name and priority of the current thread. In the `main` method, two instances of `Priority` are created, and their priorities are set using `setPriority`. The threads are then started using `start`.

package com.company;

class MyThr1 extends Thread {
    public MyThr1(String name) {
        super(name); // Call the constructor of the superclass (Thread) with a given name
    }
    
    public void run() {
        int i = 34;
        while (true) {
            // Print a message with the thread's name
            System.out.println("Thank you: " + this.getName());
        }
    }
}

public class thread_priorities {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create instances of MyThr1 with different priorities
        MyThr1 t1 = new MyThr1("Divesh1");
        MyThr1 t2 = new MyThr1("Divesh2");
        MyThr1 t3 = new MyThr1("Divesh3");
        MyThr1 t4 = new MyThr1("Divesh4");
        MyThr1 t5 = new MyThr1("Divesh5 (most Important)");
        
        // Set priorities
        t5.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        t3.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        t4.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        
        // Start the threads
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
        t4.start();
        t5.start();
    }
}

This code defines a `MyThr1` class that extends `Thread`. The `run` method contains a loop printing a message with the thread's name. In the `main` method, instances of `MyThr1` are created with different priorities, and those priorities are set using `setPriority`. The threads are then started.
