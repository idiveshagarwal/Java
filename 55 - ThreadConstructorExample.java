class MyThr extends Thread {
    public MyThr(String name) {
        super(name); // Call the constructor of the superclass (Thread) with a given name
    }

    public void run() {
        int i = 34; // Initialize an integer variable
        System.out.println("Thank you"); // Print a message
        // while loop is commented out
    }
}

This code defines a class `MyThr` that extends `Thread`. It has a constructor that takes a parameter `name`, which is passed to the constructor of the superclass using `super(name)`. The `run` method contains a print statement.

public class thread_constructor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThr t1 = new MyThr("Divesh"); // Create an instance of MyThr with name "Divesh"
        MyThr t2 = new MyThr("Ram Candr"); // Create another instance with name "Ram Candr"
        t1.start(); // Start the first thread
        t2.start(); // Start the second thread
        System.out.println("The id of the thread t is " + t1.getId()); // Print the ID of the first thread
        System.out.println("The name of the thread t is " + t1.getName()); // Print the name of the first thread
        System.out.println("The id of the thread t is " + t2.getId()); // Print the ID of the second thread
        System.out.println("The name of the thread t is " + t2.getName()); // Print the name of the second thread
    }
}

This code defines a class `thread_constructor` with the `main` method. It creates instances of `MyThr` with different names and starts the threads. It then prints the ID and name of each thread.

**Note:** The code provided is mostly correct. However, the commented-out `while` loop in the `run` method of `MyThr` might have been part of the initial implementation for thread execution. Depending on the intended functionality, this loop can be uncommented and modified accordingly.
