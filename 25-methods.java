Questions and descriptions of each part:

The method static int logic(int x, int y): This is a static method that takes two integers as parameters (x and y) and returns an integer value (z). The method calculates the value of 'z' based on the conditions inside the method and returns it.

The main method: This is the entry point of the program, where the program execution starts. It defines and initializes some variables 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a1', 'b1', and 'c1'.

c = logic(a, b);: This line calls the static method logic and passes 'a' and 'b' as arguments. The returned value is stored in 'c'.

System.out.println(a + " " + b);: This line prints the values of 'a' and 'b', which are still 5 and 7 respectively, even after calling the logic method.

c1 = logic(a1, b1);: This line calls the static method logic and passes 'a1' and 'b1' as arguments. The returned value is stored in 'c1'.

System.out.println(c);: This line prints the value of 'c', which is the same as the previous value of 'c' (result of logic(a, b)). The value of 'c' is 12 because the condition x > y is true, so 'z' is calculated as 'x + y', which is 5 + 7 = 12.

System.out.println(c1);: This line prints the value of 'c1', which is the result of logic(a1, b1). The value of 'c1' is 15 because the condition x > y is false, so 'z' is calculated as '(x + y) * 5', which is (2 + 1) * 5 = 15.

The output of the program will be:

5 7
12
15
